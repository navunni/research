# 1. Entering Input

# Here, we can type expressions. The (<=) is the assignment operator

x <- 12

# Example 1
print(x)

# prints out [1] 12. 
x 
# Also prints out [1] 12 (or whatever numerical value you have assigned to x) => also known as autoprinting

#[1] indicates that x is a vector and that 12 (or any assigned numerical value in the original expression is the first value)

# [:] operator is used to create sequences of integers. For example, 

x <- 1:20 
x 
# This would then print out [1] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...... and so on. It would list ALL INTEGERS within the specific interval.

# 2: Primitive Data Types: Objects and Attributes

    # a) Characters
    # b) Numerics (Real/Decimal Numbers)
    # c) Integers
    # d) Complex 
    # e) Logical (True/False values are only applicable)

    # ^The most basic object of all is a vector. **The only exception is a list => which is represented as a vector. 
    # However, a list can hold data (objects) of different classes. 

# Empty Vectors

vector()
